The J Component File for evaluating the 9-bit Processor. 

The Testbench architecture is basic setup. The testbench needs to be improvised since this was during my college days code. I accept here and there the events triggering and capturing might be not standard procedure. There might be few cases it might be violating the scenario evaluation. 

Learnt Testbench Architecture courses from Udemy. Applied same concepts to our project.
