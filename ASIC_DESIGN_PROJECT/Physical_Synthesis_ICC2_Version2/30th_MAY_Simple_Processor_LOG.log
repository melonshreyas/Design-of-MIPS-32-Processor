Warning: There is high fragmentation caused by many blockages or fixed cells.
        The median subrow width (space between blockages) is 12 sites
        and the median cell width is 7 sites. This makes it difficult for
        the legalizer to pack in the cells and can result in high
        displacements and long runtimes.
Please look for the GIF files that are written out at the end of
        legalization to see the impact of the fragmentation.

Warning: Found cells with large displacements during legalization. If the
    cells with large displacements are timing critical these displacements
    may cause problems. Please see the following plots for details.

    The 'max_displacements' plot shows the design with blockages in green
    and the legalized cells with the largest displacements drawn
    with red displacement vectors.

    The 'colored_displacements' plot shows the design with blockages in green
