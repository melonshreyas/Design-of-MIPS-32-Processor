ARGUMENTS
       -clocks clock_list
              Specifies  the  clock  trees  to  which  target  skew/latency is
              applied.  If not specified, the constraints are applied  to  all
              clocks.

       -corners corner_list
              Specifies  the  corners to which target skew/latency is applied.
              If not specified, the constraints are applied to current corner.

       -target_skew skew_value
              Specifies  the required value for maximum skew for the specified
              clock trees.  The default value for this option is 0.

       -target_latency latency_value
              Specifies the minimum early insertion delay constraint  for  the
              specified  clock  trees.   There  is  no  default value for this
              option.

       -copy_exceptions_across_modes
              Enables the automatic copying of CTS balance points  (considered
              for   balancing)   settings  from  the  mode  specified  by  the
              -from_mode option to the mode specified by the -to_mode  option.

              You  must specify the -copy_exceptions_across_modes, -from_mode,
              and -to_mode options together.

              You can specify only one group of -from_mode and  -to_mode  set-
              tings.  If  additional  groups  are needed, they need additional
              commands.  The modes across different groups  must  be  mutually
              exclusive.

       -from_mode original_mode
              Specifies the mode from which to copy to CTS balance points. You
              can specify only one mode.

              You must specify the -copy_exceptions_across_modes,  -from_mode,
              and -to_mode options together.

       -to_mode mode_list
              Specifies the modes to which to copy the CTS balance points. You
              can specify one or more modes.

              You must specify the -copy_exceptions_across_modes,  -from_mode,
              and -to_mode options together.

       -root_ndr_fanout_limit fanout_limit_value
              Specifies the boundary on the clock nets where root NDR/layer or
              internal NDR/layer should be applied, depending on the number of
              transitive  fanout  of  the  clock  net  driver.  The transitive
              fanouts include register CK pin that are valid  sinks  and  does
              not  include  ignore pins and they are counted per master clock.
              If a net driver is on multiple (master) clock domain, the max of
              downstream transitive fanouts for each clock domain will be con-
              sidered.  If the downstream transitive fanout of a net driver is
              larger  than  or equal to this user-specified fanout limit, root
              NDR/layer would be used for that net; If the downstream  transi-
              tive  fanout of a net driver is smaller than this user-specified
              fanout limit, internal NDR/layer would be  used  for  that  net;
              This is also called fanout-based ndr.

       -max_incr_repeater_levels level_value
              Specifies  the  maximum  number  of incrementally added repeater
              level during  concurrent  clock  and  data  (CCD)  optimization,
              depending  on the repeater level of each sink. The -clock option
              could be used together to  specify  clock.  Newer  setting  will
              overwrite  the  older  one  on the same clock and be treated the
              same as the first time it's being set.

DESCRIPTION
       Specifies settings  like  target  skew/latency  for  clocks,  exception
       duplication across modes or fanout-based ndr limit.

       If target skew is specified, clock tree synthesis engine minimizes skew
       to meet the specified target.  After this target is met, the  optimiza-
       tion  concentrates more on other QoR goals, such as insertion delay and
       area.

       If target latency is specified, clock tree synthesis  engine  minimizes
       latency  to  meet  the specified target.  After this target is met, the
       optimization concentrates more on other QoR goals,  such  as  skew  and
       area.  If  the  insertion delay of this initial optimized clock tree is
       smaller than the specified value, the clock tree synthesis engine  adds
       a  chain of cells from the reference list as needed to meet this delay.

       If fanout-based ndr is specified,  clock  tree  synthesis  engine  will
       apply root/internal rules based on the limit setting. The sink ndr rule
       will not be affected and remain as sink ndr rule. Small net (e.g., bbox
       <  10um)  will  still  have internal rules even if its fanout is larger
       than limit.

       To   report    target    skew/latency    constraint    settings,    use
       report_clock_tree_options.

       To      remove      target      skew/latency      constraints,      use
       remove_clock_tree_options.

       To report fanout-based ndr settings, use report_clock_tree_options.

       To remove fanout-based ndr settings, use remove_clock_tree_options.

EXAMPLES
       The following example sets a target skew of 2.0 units for clock clk1.

              prompt> set_clock_tree_options -target_skew 2.0 -clock clk1

              The following example sets a target latency of 4.0 units for all
              clocks.

              prompt> set_clock_tree_options -target_latency 4.0
