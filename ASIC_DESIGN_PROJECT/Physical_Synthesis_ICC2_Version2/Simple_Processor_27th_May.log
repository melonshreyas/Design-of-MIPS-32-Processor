Warning: Found cells with large displacements during legalization. If the
    cells with large displacements are timing critical these displacements
    may cause problems. Please see the following plots for details.

    The 'max_displacements' plot shows the design with blockages in green
    and the legalized cells with the largest displacements drawn
    with red displacement vectors.

    The 'colored_displacements' plot shows the design with blockages in green
    and with placed cells colored according to their displacements.
    The mapping of colors to displacements can be seen in the
    legend in the lower right.
