Using per-layer congestion maps for congestion reduction.
Information: 1.22% of design has horizontal routing density above target_routing_density of 0.80.
Information: 1.39% of design has vertical routing density above target_routing_density of 0.80.
Running placement using 1 thread(s)
Information: Automatic density control has selected the following settings: max_density 0.60, congestion_driven_max_util 0.60. (PLACE-027)
coarse place 100% done.
Information: Reducing cell density for 0.8% of the movable cells to alleviate congestion. This changes the average cell density in non-congested areas from 0.59 to 0.59. (PLACE-030)
