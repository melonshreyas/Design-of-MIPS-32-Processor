Open nets were found during extraction.

Open nets are composed of multiple resistively connected groups (RCGs).

StarRC attempts to determine the location where a net becomes open using
the topology of the extracted resistor network. However, this determination
is approximate. This determination is also affected by settings of the
REDUCTION, REDUCTION_MAX_DELAY_ERROR and EXTRACTION options.

OPEN net: b[0]  (2 RCGs) :
	shorting resistor: 2 (resistance=0.01,width=100) is inserted between nodes b[0]:2 (located at (4.7590,0.2885), layer M4) and b_r_reg_0_:D (located at (1.9350,2.5000), layer M1 (floating))
OPEN net: b_r[0]  (2 RCGs) :
	shorting resistor: 15 (resistance=0.01,width=100) is inserted between nodes lb/U32:A2 (located at (2.6650,4.8355), layer M1) and b_r_reg_0_:Q (located at (3.4790,2.3020), layer M1 (floating))
