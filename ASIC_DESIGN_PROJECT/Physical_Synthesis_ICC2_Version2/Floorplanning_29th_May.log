ARGUMENTS
       -control_type core | die
              Specifies whether the side_length and side_ratio  options  apply
              to  the core or the die boundary. If set to die, then the dimen-
              sions will be applied to the die boundary  and  the  core_offset
              values  will  be subtracted from the dimensions to determine the
              core boundary. If set to core (default), the dimensions will  be
              applied  to the core boundary and the core_offset values will be
              added to the dimensions to determine the final die boundary.  By
              default, the control type is core.

       -shape R | L | T | U
              Specifies  the  shape  to  be  used  by the command. If the con-
              trol_type is die, this option applies to the die boundary shape.
              The  argument  to this option specifies a template shape used to
              determine the cell boundary and core shape  of  the  rectilinear
              block.  The  following diagram shows the definition of the edges
              and the orientation of  the  R-,  L-,  T-,  and  U-  rectilinear
              blocks. By default, the core shape is R (rectangular).

       -side_length { side_a side_b [side_c side_d side_e side_f]}
              Specifies  the  side  lengths for the edges of the floorplan. If
              the control_type is die, the  side  lengths  apply  to  the  die
              boundary.  Each  dimension  in the list represents the length of
              the edge. If you provide more values than required  to  describe
              the specified shape, the extra values are ignored. If you do not
              provide all of the values required  to  describe  the  specified
              shape,  the  tool  issues  an  error message. There are only two
              dimensions for -shape R: width and height. This option is  mutu-
              ally exclusive with the -side_ratio option.

       -side_ratio { side_a side_b [side_c side_d side_e side_f]}
              Specifies  the  relative  proportion  of  the floorplan edges in
              relation to each other. If the control_type  is  die,  the  side
              rations  apply  to the boundary side settings. Each dimension in
              the list represents the relative proportion of the dimension  of
              the  edge  to the sum of all the dimensions listed. For example,
              if the list of dimensions of an L-shaped block is {1 2 1 1}, the
              tool  calculates  the  dimension  of  side a, c, or d (where the
              value is 1) as 20% (1/1+2+1+1) of  the  sum  of  the  dimensions
              listed.  The dimension of side b is 40% of the summation, and so
              on.

       -core_utilization ratio
              Specifies the utilization of the core area. The  utilization  is
              the  total  area  of the core occupied by all standard cells and
              macro cells divided by the total core area. You  can  specify  a
              value  between 0 and 1.  The cell area includes all standard and
              macro cells. For example, a core utilization  of  0.8  specifies
              that  80  percent of the core area is used for cell placement at
              this stage. The tool might later add more cell area, the remain-
              ing area is available for routing. By default, the core utiliza-
              tion is 0.7.

       -keep_boundary
              Uses the existing die boundary. If this option is specified  and
              the core-based constraints result in a core that is too large to
              fit in the existing die boundary, the command  issues  an  error
              message. Default is not specified.

       -boundary { {x y} {x y} {x y} {x y} ... }
              Specifies  the  shape  to  be  used  by the command. If the con-
              trol_type is core, then the boundary defines the core  area  and
              the  core_offsets should be added to create the die boundary. If
              control_type is die, then the core_offset is subtracted from the
              die boundary to create the core boundary.

       -orientation N | W | S | E
              Specifies  one  of  four possible orientations for the specified
              rectilinear shape. The tool repositions the block to the  speci-
              fied  orientation  by  rotating it in a clockwise direction. For
              -shape R, the orientation is always N.

       -coincident_boundary true | false
              Specifies whether the die boundary  follows  the  shape  of  the
              core.  If  true,  the die boundary assumes the same shape as the
              core and requires a -core_offset setting with the same number of
              sides as the core. If false, the die boundary is rectangular and
              the -core_offset option requires only four values. When the  die
              boundary  is  rectangular it is created with -core_offset values
              such that the offset value is honored to the closest  core  edge
              on  a  per side basis. In this case, the bounding box of the die
              boundary is the minimum size that meets  all  four  -core_offset
              values. By default, this option is true.

       -core_offset  {  value  |  vertical_value horizontal_value | side_1 ...
       side_N}
              Specifies the distance between the side of the core and the side
              of the die boundary. If only one value is specified,  the  value
              is  used  for  all sides. If two values are specified, the first
              value is applied to all vertical edges and then second value  is
              applied  to  all horizontal edges. Side numbers are based on the
              standard rectilinear numbering  and  do  not  correlate  to  the
              side_a,  side_b,  and so on. numbering scheme used to define the
              size of each edge. By default, the core  offset  equals  to  the
              minimum  I/O  cell  height.  If there are no I/O cells, the core
              offset is 0.

       -row_core_ratio ratio
              Specifies the amount of channel area between cell  rows  in  the
              core  area to reserve for routing. The ratio is a number between
              0 and 1.0. A smaller row-to-core ratio creates  more  space  for
              routing  channels.  A  value  of  1.0 creates no routing channel
              space. By default, the ratio is 1.0. Note that this ratio should
              be equal to or greater than the core utilization value.

       -flip_first_row true | false
              Specifies  whether the command flips the first row at the bottom
              of the core area for horizontally placed cell rows, or flips the
              leftmost  row  for vertically placed cell rows. By default, this
              option is true.

       -keep_pg_route
              Specifies that the command keeps the  PG  routes  and  does  not
              delete them. By default, the command delete all existing routes.

       -keep_detail_route
              Specifies that the command keeps all the routes except PG routes
              and  does  not  delete  them. By default, the command delete all
              existing routes.

       -keep_placement {io macro block std_cell physical_only all}
              Specifies that the command  keeps  the  placement  of  specified
              object  types.  The valid value for this options are: io, macro,
              block, std_cell, physical_only, all.

              io   means   objects   with   design   type   "flip_chip_driver,
              flip_chip_pad, corner, pad, pad_spacer";

              macro means objects with design type "macro, analog, abstract";

              block means objects with design type "module, black_box";

              physical_only  means  objects  with  design type "physical_only,
              fill";

              std_cell means objects with design type "lib_cell, cover, diode,
              end_cap, well_tap, filler";

              all means all objects with design type list above.

       -keep_objects object_name_or_collection
              Specifies  the  objects  to be kept. Currently supported objects
              are cells and nets. Specify  the  objects  either  by  using  an
              object  access  command,  such  as  get_cells or get_nets, or by
              specifying object name patterns in a Tcl list.

       -keep_object_types {placement_blockage routing_blockage move_bound}
              Specifies the object type to be kept. Currently supported object
              types are placement_blockage, routing_blockage and move_bound.

       -keep_all
              Specifies  this  option  to  keep  macro,  std_cell,  IO, physi-
              cal_only, block, blockage, detail_route and pg_route.

       -honor_pad_limit
              Adjusts the core and die size to honor pad-limited  designs.  If
              this  option is not specified, the core area is created based on
              the default core utilization ratio 0.7.

              The option can be used only for rectangular floorplans, not  for
              L, T, or U shapes.

              The assumption for the command option is that the pad-type cells
              ()I/O pads or flip chip  drivers)  will  be  placed  around  the
              design boundary.

       -site_def site_def_name
              Specifies  the  site  def to be used in floorplan when there are
              multiple site defs in the technology file. The default is to use
              default  site def.  If there is no default site def, the command
              uses the site def with the smallest site width.

       -use_site_row
              By default, the initialize_floorplan command  creates  siteArray
              objects. This option forces the command to create siteRow rather
              than siteArray.

       -origin_offset {x y}
              Specifies the location of  the  lower-left  corner  of  the  die
              boundary bbox with respect to the origin of the block.

       -row_pattern {row_pattern_name}
              Specifies  the name of row_pattern to be used for floorplan when
              there are row patterns specification in the physical  rule  sec-
              tion of technology file.

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  floorplan  with a boundary, core, site array (or rows), and
       wire tracks. Before executing this command, you must  open  a  physical
       design  by  using  the  open_block command, or create a design with the
       read_verilog or read_verilog_outline commands.

EXAMPLES
       The following example creates a rectangular core and die boundary  with
       a core utilization of 80% and a core offset of 1000 um for each side.

         prompt> initialize_floorplan -core_utilization 0.8 \
                 -core_offset {1000 1000 1000 1000}

       The following example creates a rectangular die boundary and a T-shaped
