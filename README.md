# Design-of-MIPS-32-Processor
Source : NPTEL Course : Hardware Design using Verilog by Prof. INDRANIL SENGUPTA 

Designing of RISC processor ISA with pipeline Implementation in Modelsim â€“ Altera and Intel Quartus tool. The MIPS 32 instructions of Register type and Immediate type were implemented. It is a 32-bit processor, i.e. can operate on 32 bits of data at a time. 
The Types of Instruction and thier encoding is as follows :
\n (a) R-type ( Register type )
\n (b) I-type ( Immediate type )
\n (c) J-type ( Jump type )
