# Design-of-9 bit Processor
This Git Repository has implementation of 9-bit basic-processor. 


MIPS-32-Processor : The concepts is used in implementing above 9-bit Processor.

Designing of RISC processor ISA with pipeline Implementation in Modelsim – Altera and Intel Quartus tool. The MIPS 32 instructions of Register type and Immediate type were implemented. It is a 32-bit processor, i.e. can operate on 32 bits of data at a time. 
The Types of Instruction and thier encoding is as follows :
(a) R-type ( Register type ).
(b) I-type ( Immediate type ).
(c) J-type ( Jump type ).

R-type Instruction Encoding
An instruction can use up to three register operands.
- Two source and one destination.
-
